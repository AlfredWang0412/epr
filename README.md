# `$ epr.py`

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wustho/epr/master/screenshot.png)

CLI Epub reader written in Python 3.7 with features:

- remember last read file (just run `epr.py` without any argument)
- remember last reading state for each file (per file saved state written to `$HOME/.epr`)
- adjustable text area width
- support EPUB3 (tested on some, still no media supports though)
- added secondary vim-like key bindings

Inspired by: https://github.com/aerkalov/ebooklib & https://github.com/rupa/epub

## Limitations

- [Fixed] ~~saving state doesn't work with a file that has `[]` in its name, e.g. `[EPUB]some_title.epub`. As workaround, just rename and remove `[]` from its name. (Probably fix this next weekend)~~
- doesn't support images
- ~~doesn't support epub3~~
- minimum width: 22 cols
- resizing terminal will reset to beginning of current chapter
- saved state (reading position & width, but not reading chapter) will reset 
  if current terminal size is incompatible with latest reading state

## Dependancies

- `html2text`
- `curses`

## Usages

To read an EPUBFILE:


```shell
$ epr.py EPUBFILE
```

To read last read epub:

```shell
$ epr.py
```
